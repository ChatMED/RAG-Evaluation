  "document": "First report of tumor treating fields use in combination with bevacizumab in a pediatric patient: a case report",
  "Introduction": "This document reports the first case of a pediatric patient with glioblastoma (GBM; WHO grade IV astrocytoma) successfully treated with tumor treating fields (TTF). The patient was diagnosed with GBM when 13 years of age and progressed through surgical resection, radiotherapy and chemotherapy.",
  "Thoughts": "The patient was monitored for 6 months with subsequent stable disease observed radiographically and clinically for 7 months while adherent to OptuneÂ® (TTF). TTF thereby played a role in forestalling recurrent GBM growth in this young woman for 7 months without significant adverse effects.",
  "Answers": "The authors propose that TTF therapy is a potential valuable treatment in this small, but sick, patient population.",
  "Hallmarks": "The patient was diagnosed with GBM when 13 years of age and progressed through surgical resection, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. TTF therapy played a role in forestalling recurrent GBM growth in this young woman for 7 months without significant adverse effects.",
  "Images": "The document includes MRI brain images at the time of tumor diagnosis, postoperative MRI brain images shortly after starting bevacizumab and tumor treating fields, and postoperative MRI brain images at the time of tumor progression.",
  "Further_Development": "The authors suggest that TTF should undergo further evaluation in clinical trials to confirm their benefit in children as observed in adult high-grade glioma.",
  "Thoughts_I": "The use of TTF in cases of pediatric high-grade glioma remains a novel suggestion with no clinical trials currently in progress.",
  "Answers_I": "The authors suggest that TTF are a potential valuable treatment in this very small, but acutely sick, patient population.",
  "Answers_II": null,
  "Further_Thoughts": "The authors state that they have obtained appropriate institutional review board approval or have followed the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki for all human or animal experimental investigations.",
  "Ependymoma": null
